```
./gradlew clean assemble
```

To run your application:
```
./gradlew clean run

== Redis

To start a Redis Stack container using the redis-stack image, run the following command in your terminal:
```
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

The docker run command above also exposes RedisInsight on port 8001. You can use RedisInsight by pointing your browser to localhost:8001.

Connect with redis-cli
You can then connect to the server using redis-cli, just as you connect to any Redis instance.

If you donâ€™t have redis-cli installed locally, you can run it from the Docker container:
```
docker exec -it redis-stack redis-cli
```
